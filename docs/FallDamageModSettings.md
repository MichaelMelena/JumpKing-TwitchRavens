# Fall Damage Mod Settings

The **'Fall Damage'** tab in the settings editor will provide you with configurable options to determine how your Fall Damage will work

- **Enabled:** Ticking this will mean the Fall Damage Mod is now enabled and will be used by Jump King. You will still need to turn it on once in game manually.
- **Toggle Key:** Press this key to enable/disable the mod once the game is running. Health will be saved between toggles and game sessions! Useful if you're playing on a custom map where you have to fall down to progress.
- **Fall Damage Modifier:** This number is applied to the distance you fell in order to calculate the damage. A value of 0.1 works out at around 48 damage per screen. Your max health is 100.
- **Nice Spawns:** the DLC Maps branch off from the main Jump King map, with this setting enabled a death on NG+ will spawn you at the Imp Room when you first diverge from the base map. Similarly, a death on 'Ghost of the Babe' will spawn you at the bottom of the Bog. If this setting is disabled you will instead spawn at the bottom of the base map and have to climb to the DLC maps each time.
- **Blood Splat Enabled:** When you take damage from a fall a blood splatter will be left behind. These will persist between sessions and can be a fun way to keep track of your pain.
- **Clear Blood Key:** Press this key to clear all blood splatters from the world.
