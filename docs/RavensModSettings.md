- **Toggle Raven Spawning Key:** Press this key during play to toggle whether Ravens will spawn at all. Useful if you need a break!

- **Trigger Type:** How chat can trigger the Ravens, see the below section for more information

The supported Trigger Types are as follows:
- **ChatMessage (Twitch/YouTube):** For every message sent in chat, a Raven will attempt to be spawned
- **ChannelPointReward (Twitch):** Chatters redeem a channel point reward in order to spawn a Raven
- **Insult:** Spawns a number of Ravens on every fall with a set of configurable insults

## Channel Point Reward Setup

In order to set up a Channel Point Reward for your Chat Ravens, first create a Custom Channel Point Reward through the Twitch Channel Dashboard. Make sure you require the viewer to enter text!
