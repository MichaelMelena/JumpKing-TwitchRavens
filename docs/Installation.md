## Installation

**If you're not using Steam, make a copy of the MonoGame.Framework.dll in your Game's install directory first! It will make uninstalling easier!**

Check the [Release](https://github.com/PhantomBadger/JumpKingMod/releases/) page for the latest download

**(If v1.1) Before unzipping the downloaded .zip, Right Click, select 'Properties' and if there is an option at the bottom to 'Unblock' the file, tick it, and click 'Apply'**

This will ensure that the mod loader isn't treated as a harmful application when running.
- Run the Installer.UI.exe inside the Installer Folder

- Click the '...' next to the Game Directory text box and point this at your Jump King Install Directory (the place where JumpKing.exe is)
- Click the '...' next to the Mod Directory text box and point this at the Mod folder in the Install package (in the .zip you downloaded from the Release page)
- Click 'Install', a pop-up should appear confirming it has succeeded
- Select your Streaming Platform of choice and fill in the desired settings!

- You can now launch the game normally from Steam/however you normally launch. You can be sure the mod has been installed correctly because a Console Window will open alongside
